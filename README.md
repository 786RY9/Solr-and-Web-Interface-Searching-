# Solr and Flask Pdc Lab 11: Indexing, Importing, and Searching Data in Apache Solr

## Introduction
Apache Solr is a high-performance, scalable, full-text search engine. It is widely used in applications requiring complex searching and indexing of large volumes of data, such as e-commerce websites, enterprise applications, and big data platforms.

## Indexing Data
Indexing enables users to quickly locate information in documents by collecting, parsing, and storing them for efficient search performance.

## Importing Data
Solr supports importing data from various sources like XML, CSV, database tables, and file formats like Word and PDF. Common ways to import data:
- Using **Solr Cell** (Apache Tika).
- Uploading XML via HTTP requests.
- Writing custom Java applications with Solrâ€™s Client API.

## Searching
Solr processes search queries via **request handlers**, offering features like:
- Full-text search
- Hit highlighting
- Faceted search
- Geospatial search
- Dynamic clustering

Solr is highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and powers search features for major internet sites.
